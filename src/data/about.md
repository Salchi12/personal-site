# Intro

I am a BsC. Computing and Informatics graduated of [ITN CIBERTEC](https://www.cibertec.edu.pe/) , since I was a kid always I've been interested in how the computers works and always I've been learning about that.
Maybe this things make me love anything about programming and how the internet works.

# Currently

Actually I've been working on [NTT DATA PERU](https://pe.nttdata.com/about-us) like Quality Assurance Engeering where I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with any people.
